Help me design the programming language `XORM` (`⊕M`).
`XORM` is just xor and macros.
There also exists 2 abstract 8-bit registers: `R1` and `R0`.
Macros are the only abstraction allowed.
There is exactly one runtime instruction, xor (⊕):
  R0 = R0 ⊕ R1
A lisp (racket) can be used to implement macros
